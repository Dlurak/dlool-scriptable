# Dlool Scriptable Collection

This is a collection of scripts for [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) app for iOS.
These scripts can improve your experience with the [Dlool](https://dlool-frontend.vercel.app) web-app. When you aren't familiar with Dlool itself, I recommend you to check the frontend repository [here](https://github.com/Dlurak/dloolFrontend) first.

## Installation

1. Install [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) app on your iOS device from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188).
2. Open the app and create a new script.
3. Copy the content of the script you want to use from this repository and paste it into the new script.
4. When the script has more installation steps, you can find them in the README of the script.

## Scripts

### Apple Reminders synchronization

Using [this](/reminders/README.md) script you can synchronize your Dlool homework with the Apple Reminders app.

### Newest Homework Widget

[This](/widgets/newest/README.md) widget displays the newest homework for a given class. It is comparable to the first box in the Dlool Web-App.
