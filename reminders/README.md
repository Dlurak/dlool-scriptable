# Apple Reminders synchronization

Using this script you can synchronize your Dlool homework with the Apple Reminders app.

## Installation

1. Change the `school` and `className` variables in the first lines of the script to your school and class name.
2. Think about when you want to run the script. You can run it manually from time to time, or you can use a automation in the *Siri Shortcuts* app.

## Usage Information

The last cryptic line of the reminder is the ID of the homework in Dlool. **Do not remove or change it!**.  
The script needs it to update the homework/not create duplicates.

## Known Issues

When a homework is deleted in Dlool, it will not be deleted in the Reminders app.
