# Newest Homework Widget

This widget displays the newest homework for a given class. It is comparable to the first box in the Dlool Web-App.

## Installation

1. Change the `school` and `className` variables in the first lines of the script to your school and class name.
2. Create a new Scriptable widget on the homescreen. I recommend using the medium size.
3. Tap on the widget and select the script you just created.

## Examples

![Error state](./assets/error.png)

This can happen if the script is configured incorrectly or if there is a error when fetching the data e.g. because your device is not connected to the internet.

![Normal state](./assets/success.png)

This is the normal state of the widget. It shows the newest homework for the given class.
