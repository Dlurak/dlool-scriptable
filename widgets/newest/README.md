# Newest Homework Widget

This widget displays the newest homework for a given class. It is comparable to the first box in the Dlool Web-App.

## Installation

1. Change the `school` and `className` variables in the first lines of the script to your school and class name.
2. Create a new Scriptable widget on the homescreen. I recommend using the medium size.
3. Tap on the widget and select the script you just created.

## Examples

Images will be avaliable in the near future.
